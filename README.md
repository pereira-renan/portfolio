## Hey!

This is my portfolio.

It was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), most of the UI elements are either by [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) or [React Bits](https://reactbits.dev/), and is currently hosted to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

You wanna take a look, you can go [here](https://pereirarenan.com/) or you can run it locally, I recommend using pnpm.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
